            their equipment for the next 2 rounds. The game is played in a best-of-5 format. If both teams have won 4 rounds
            each, a final round begins with both sides able to choose any weapon they prefer. All players are automatically 
            equipped with basic items such as a vest and helmet from the start of the round. This mode takes place on its own 
            map known as Iron Dome.</h-3></p>

            Free Fire features a character system of 50+ characters. Each character has a unique skill which can be active or passive. 
            Active skills can be triggered manually by an in-game button and passive skills are triggered automatically. Each character
            can equip 4 skills including the character's skill and 3 skills from other characters (one active skill and three passive 
            kills can be equipped by a single character).[26] Free Fire characters have unique backstories. A few of these characters 
            were inspired by real-life celebrities whom Free Fire had collaborations with, such as Chrono from the collaboration with
            Cristiano Ronaldo,[27] Dimitri & Thiva from the collaboration with Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike,[28] A-Patroa from the collaboration
            with Anitta,[29] Alok from the collaboration with DJ Alok[30] and JBeibs from the collaboration with Justin Bieber.In the game,
            it is possible to acquire all characters by using gold, an in-game currency that can be earned through gameplay and event
            participation, or with Diamonds which can be bought with real-world currency.</h-3></p>

                In Free Fire, pets can provide support to players during fights. As of 2023, the game features 21 different pets that 
                players can choose to bring into battle. Each pet has a special ability that sets it apart from the others. Some of
                these abilities are passive and trigger automatically, while others are active and require manual activation. One of
                the pets in the game, Poring, was added as part of a collaboration with Ragnarok Online. Players can also customize 
                their pets with skins and emotes</h-3></p>

                <p><h-3>
                    In Free Fire, a seven-tier ranking system, including sub-tiers like Bronze I, II, III, categorizes players by skill 
                    and performance. Players earn ranking points based on kills, damage, survival time and standing position, progressing
                    from Bronze to Grandmaster. Seasons reset ranks (e.g., from Silver III to Bronze I or II). There are two ranked modes: 
                    Battle Royale rank mode and Clash Squad rank mode</h-3></p>
