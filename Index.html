    <p><h-3>In Free Fire, players control a character in a third-person perspective. The fire button 
        allows them to shoot and throw items. The character can perform actions such as jumping, crawling, 
        and lying down. During gameplay, players can utilize the "Gloo Wall" grenade as a form of cover
        to protect against damage</h-3></p>

        <h2><b>Game modes</b></h2>
        <p><h-3>Free Fire offers over 15 game modes, including Team Deathmatch, Clash Squad, Big Head,
            Explosive Jump, Cold Steel, Zombie Hunt, Rampage, and Pet Mania.[15] However, modes other 
            than Battle Royale, Clash Squad, and Lone Wolf are only available during special events The 
            Battle Royale mode in Free Fire accommodates up to 52 players landing on an island without 
            weapons. They must fight to be the last one standing by scavenging weapons and equipment from
            buildings. Playing this mode in ranked mode will affect their ranking. There are 6 maps to
            choose from: Bermuda, Bermuda Remastered, Kalahari, Purgatory, Alpine, and NeXTerra. The mode
            allows for solo, duo, or squad play.</h-3></p>
        <h2><b>Clash Squad</b></h2>
        <p><h-3>is a 4-player versus 4-player mode where players purchase weapons and items 
            from an in-game shop during preparation time, then engage in combat against the opposing team. 
            The mode is played in a best-of-7 format, lasting anywhere from 4 to 7 rounds. Each round 
            is won when all players from one team are killed, either by their opponents or through environmental factors. 
            As of 2022, the maps used in Clash Squad are the same as those in Battle Royale mode. 
            The mode can be played as either Ranked or Casua</h-3></p>
